        <h1>Inspiration</h1>
        <h2>Pramukh Swami Maharaj</h2>
        <p>Pramukh Swami Maharaj is my role model.
            He is my inspiration because of how he lives his life.
            I strive to embibe his motto "In the joy of others, lies our own"
            into my life. He is my spiritual guide through my life and countless other people's lives.

        <p>From the images above he strived to connect with youths. He taught them spiritual values, which helped them become a better person. By seeing these images, I understood the value of a Guru (guide), a person who can bring me from the darkness to light. That is who Pramukh Swami Maharaj is to me.</p>
        <p>There is a special memeory attached to the last two pictures. All the youths were having a sports summer camp in the Pocconos that year. And when Pramukh Swami Maharaj came, we asked him to play a couple of sports with use. Unknown to us, he had a frozen shoulder at the time. He played with us even though he was in pain, to make us happy.</p>

        <p>Although he passed away in 2016, his work inspired many people. This video reminds me of excatly that. It teaches me how to live a life in the joy of others.</p>

        <h2>Why Computer Science?</h2>
        <p>As a kid, I was fascinated by the world of computers. The joy of imagining what could be ignited a passion in me to explore the power of technology.
            
            Fast forward to today, my insatiable curiosity has led me to study Computer Science at Rutgers University, New Brunswick.</p>
