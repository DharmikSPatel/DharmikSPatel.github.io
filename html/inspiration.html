        <h2>Pramukh Swami Maharaj</h2>
        <p>Pramukh Swami Maharaj is my role model. He is my inspiration because of how he lives his life. I strive to imbibe his motto, "In the joy of others lies our own," into my life. He is my spiritual guide through my life and countless other people's lives.</p>

        <p>From the pictures above, he strived to connect with youths. He taught them spiritual values, which helped them become a better person. By seeing these images, I understood the importance of a Guru (guide), a person who can bring me from the darkness to light. That is who Pramukh Swami Maharaj is to me.</p>
        <p>There is a special memory attached to the last two pictures. All the youths had a sports summer camp in the Poconos that year. And when Pramukh Swami Maharaj came, we asked him to play a couple of sports with us. Unknown to us, he had a frozen shoulder at the time. He played with us even though he was in pain to make us happy.</p>

        <p>Although he passed away in 2016, his work inspired many people. This video reminds me of exactly that. It teaches me how to live a life in the joy of others.</p>
        <h2>Why Computer Science?</h2>
        <p>As a kid, I was fascinated by the world of computers, and the joy of imagining what could be, ignited a passion in me to explore the power of technology. Fast forward to today, my insatiable curiosity has led me to study Computer Science at Rutgers University, New Brunswick.<div class="nav">
